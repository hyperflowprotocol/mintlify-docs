# Risk Policy

**Oracle:** Hyperliquid Index  
**Fallback:** Chainlink + internal aggregator  
**Deviation Limit:** Â±0.5% triggers auto-halt  
**Funding:** Every 1 hour, capped at 50 bps/hour

If the builder's oracle deviates or uptime drops below 98%, the 500k HYPE stake gets slashed.

Auto-halt settles positions at mark price to prevent cascading liquidations.

**Margin:** Isolated only  
**Max Leverage:** 25x (BTC/ETH), 10x (HYPE)  
**OI Cap:** ~$2M per market
