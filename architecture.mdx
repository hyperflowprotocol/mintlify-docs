# Architecture

**Frontend:**  Next.js + Tailwind  
**Backend:**   Node.js + Fastify  
**Database:**  Postgres 16  
**Cache:**     Redis  
**Monitoring:** Grafana, Loki, Sentry  
**Deploy:**    Vercel (frontend), AWS (API)

## How it works

User places order through frontend, hits our API gateway, routes through HIP-3 to the deployed market (backed by our 500k HYPE stake). Oracle feeds price data, everything logs to Postgres for charts and PnL tracking.

Everything runs through HIP-3. No third-party APIs, no off-chain dependencies.

## Key Components

**HIP-3 Router:** Routes orders to builder-deployed markets  
**Oracle Service:** Pulls price feeds from Hyperliquid validators  
**Risk Engine:** Monitors positions, triggers liquidations  
**Indexer:** Logs trades, funding, PnL to Postgres

## RPC Endpoints

**Mainnet:** `https://rpc.hyperliquid.xyz`  
**Testnet:** `https://testnet.hyperliquid.xyz`

All market data flows through these endpoints. No external dependencies.
