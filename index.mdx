# Hyper Leverage — HIP-3 Perps Exchange

**Version:** v0.9b  
**Network:** Hyperliquid (Chain ID 999)  
**Builder:** Hyperflow Labs  
**Stake:** 500k HYPE locked for deployment

We're building a perp exchange on HIP-3. The idea is simple: permissionless perps that trade like native Hyperliquid.

This is closed beta. Limited access. Everything here is experimental — we're stress-testing order routing, funding calculations, and risk systems before going live.

If you're in, trade small, break things, report what fails.
