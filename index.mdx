# Hyper Leverage — HIP-3 Perpetual Exchange (Closed Beta)

**Version:** v0.9b  
**Network:** Hyperliquid HIP-3 Testnet  
**Builder:** Hyperflow Labs  
**Stake Requirement:** 500 000 HYPE (locked)

Hyper Leverage is a builder-deployed perpetual exchange built on HIP-3.  
The goal is to make permissionless perps trade like native Hyperliquid — fast, fair, and transparent.

This closed beta is limited access. Everything is experimental: we're validating  
order routing, funding accuracy, and risk behavior before mainnet release.

Trade small, find the edge cases, and report what breaks.
